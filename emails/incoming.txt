Dear privileged linguistics grad students (fellowship recipients, TAs, and AIs),

Management has automatically allotted you workstation space, but you do not currently have a specific workstation assigned to you.

To select one, please follow these steps:

1. View the workstation map at http://linguistics.github.io/cla/map

2. Don't pick any of these:

    [List of workstation occupied by the "residents" set]

3. Decide which workstation you would like, and record it beside your name in the spreadsheet at [spreadsheet url]

4. In case there are conflicts, also record your second and third preferences in subsequent columns

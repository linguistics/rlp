Hi all, by my records, each of you had a workstation last semester or were using one over the summer. But by Management's records, you don't have a TA/AI/Fellowship this semester, so you don't automatically get a workstation, and will have to apply for one (there will be several up for adoption).

In particular, the following cubes have been requested so far (see http://linguistics.github.io/cla/map to determine if you are using one of these workstations):

    [List of workstation requested by the "incoming" set]

If you're in one of those, please be sure that all your things are out so that the incoming scholar can move in. By Friday, if possible.

I will send out a call for workstation applications shortly. If you want to have access to a workstation this coming semester, you *must* apply for one.
